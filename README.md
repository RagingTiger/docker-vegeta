# tl;dr
[tigerj/vegeta](https://hub.docker.com/r/tigerj/vegeta)
`Docker image` for [`Vegeta`](https://github.com/tsenart/vegeta) HTTP load
testing tool.

## Multi-Arch Image
The below commands reference a Docker Manifest List at
[tigerj/vegeta](https://hub.docker.com/r/tigerj/vegeta)
built using Docker's BuildKit. Simply running commands using this image will
pull the matching image architecture (e.g. amd64, arm32v7, or arm64) based on
the hosts architecture. Hence, if you are on a Raspberry Pi the below commands
will work the same as if you were on a traditional amd64 desktop/laptop
computer. Check [tigerj/vegeta](https://hub.docker.com/r/tigerj/vegeta/tags) for
details on `supported architectures`.
